# Multithreaded Web Server

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the implementation and performance of a multithreaded web server capable of handling a large number of concurrent requests.

## Concepts Covered
- Client-Server Architecture
- TCP Communication
- HTTP Protocols
- Sockets
- Single-threaded vs. Multithreaded Servers
- Thread Pools

## Client-Server Communication
- Explanation of how clients communicate with servers via IP addresses, ports, and DNS.
- Overview of TCP communication, including the 3-way handshake and differences between TCP and UDP.
- Types of HTTP protocols: HTTPS 1.0 (non-persistent) and 1.1 (persistent).

## Sockets and Operating Systems
- Explanation of sockets and their interaction with the operating system.
- Detailed process of opening sockets, listening, accepting connections, and handling communication.

## Single-threaded vs. Multithreaded Servers
- Single-threaded server limitations: blocking behavior and inability to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
- Multithreaded server advantages: simultaneous handling of multiple requests, context switching, and concurrent request processing.

## Thread Pools
- Introduction to thread pools and their role in optimizing server performance.
- Explanation of how thread pools manage resources efficiently by reusing threads and assigning tasks from a task queue.

## Conclusion
- Summary of the advantages of multithreaded servers and the importance of thread pools in optimizing performance.
- Mention of upcoming code implementation and performance testing.

## Next Steps
- Details about upcoming code implementation and performance testing.
- Instructions for running and testing the multithreaded web server.
